Feature: Processing Data Time
  In order to create Agency Component and Annual Report
  As an Administrator I should be able to change field(Simple Median Days)
  value in annual report to reflects on the same field of Agency component.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "Administrator" role
    And agency terms:
      | name        | field_agency_abbreviation |
      | Test Agency | TESTAGENCY                |
    And agency_component content:
      | title                 | field_agency | field_rep_start | field_agency_comp_abbreviation | path_alias             |
      | Test Agency Component | Test Agency  | 2019-01-01      | TESTAGENCYCOMPONENT            | /test-agency-component |
